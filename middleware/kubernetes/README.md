# kubernetes

`kubernetes` enables reading zone data from a kubernetes cluster. Record names
are constructed as "myservice.mynamespace.coredns.local" where:

* "myservice" is the name of the k8s service (this may include multiple DNS labels, such as "c1.myservice"),
* "mynamespace" is the k8s namespace for the service, and
* "coredns.local" is the zone configured for `kubernetes`.

The record name format can be changed by specifying a name template in the Corefile.

## Syntax

~~~
kubernetes [zones...]
~~~

* `zones` zones kubernetes should be authorative for. Overlapping zones are ignored.


~~~
kubernetes [zones] {
    endpoint http://localhost:8080
}
~~~

* `endpoint` the kubernetes API endpoint, default to http://localhost:8080

## Examples

This is the default kubernetes setup, with everything specified in full:

~~~
# Serve on port 53
.:53 {
    # use kubernetes middleware for domain "coredns.local"
    kubernetes coredns.local {
        # Use url for k8s API endpoint
        endpoint http://localhost:8080
        # Assemble k8s record names with the template
        template {service}.{namespace}.{zone}
        # Only expose the k8s namespace "demo"
        namespaces demo
    }
#    cache 160 coredns.local
}
~~~

### Basic Setup

#### Launch Kubernetes

Kubernetes is launched using the commands in the following `run_k8s.sh` script:

~~~
#!/bin/bash

# Based on instructions at: http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/docker/

#K8S_VERSION=$(curl -sS https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/latest.txt)
K8S_VERSION="v1.2.4"

ARCH="amd64"

export K8S_VERSION
export ARCH

#DNS_ARGUMENTS="--cluster-dns=10.0.0.10 --cluster-domain=cluster.local"
DNS_ARGUMENTS=""

docker run -d \
    --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
    --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
    --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:rw \
    --volume=/var/lib/kubelet/:/var/lib/kubelet:rw \
    --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
    --net=host \
    --pid=host \
    --privileged \
    gcr.io/google_containers/hyperkube-${ARCH}:${K8S_VERSION} \
    /hyperkube kubelet \
    --containerized \
    --hostname-override=127.0.0.1 \
    --api-servers=http://localhost:8080 \
    --config=/etc/kubernetes/manifests \
    ${DNS_ARGUMENTS} \
    --allow-privileged --v=2
~~~

#### Configure kubectl and test

The kubernetes control client can be downloaded from the generic URL:
`http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/${K8S_VERSION}/bin/${GOOS}/${GOARCH}/${K8S_BINARY}`

For example, the kubectl client for Linux can be downloaded using the command:
`curl -sSL "http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.2.4/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"`

The following `setup_kubectl.sh` script can be stored in the same directory as 
kubectl to setup
kubectl to communicate with kubernetes running on the localhost:

~~~
#!/bin/bash

BASEDIR=`readlink -e $(dirname ${0})`

${BASEDIR}/kubectl config set-cluster test-doc --server=http://localhost:8080
${BASEDIR}/kubectl config set-context test-doc --cluster=test-doc
${BASEDIR}/kubectl config use-context test-doc

alias kubctl="${BASEDIR}/kubectl"
~~~


Verify that kubectl is working by querying for the kubernetes namespaces:

~~~
$ ./kubectl get namespaces
NAME      STATUS    AGE
default   Active    8d
test      Active    7d
~~~


#### Launch a kubernetes service and expose the service

The following commands will create a kubernetes namespace "demo",
launch an nginx service in the namespace, and expose the service on port 80:

~~~
$ ./kubectl create namespace demo
$ ./kubectl get namespace

$ ./kubectl run mynginx --namespace=demo --image=nginx
$ ./kubectl get deployment --namespace=demo

$ ./kubectl expose deployment mynginx --namespace=demo --port=80
$ ./kubectl get service --namespace=demo
~~~


#### Launch CoreDNS

Build CoreDNS and launch using the configuration file in `conf/k8sCorefile`.
This configuration file sets up CoreDNS to use the zone `coredns.local` for
the kubernetes services.

The command to launch CoreDNS is:

~~~
$ ./coredns -conf conf/k8sCoreFile
~~~

In a separate terminal a dns query can be issued using dig:

~~~
$ dig @localhost mynginx.demo.coredns.local

; <<>> DiG 9.9.4-RedHat-9.9.4-29.el7_2.3 <<>> @localhost mynginx.demo.coredns.local

## Implementation Notes/Ideas

### Basic Zone Mapping (implemented)
The middleware is configured with a "zone" string. For 
example: "zone = coredns.local".

The Kubernetes service "myservice" running in "mynamespace" would map 
to: "myservice.mynamespace.coredns.local".

The middleware should publish an A record for that service and a service record.

Initial implementation just performs the above simple mapping. Subsequent 
revisions should allow different namespaces to be published under different zones.

For example:

    # Serve on port 53
    .:53 {
        # use kubernetes middleware for domain "coredns.local"
        kubernetes coredns.local {
            # Use url for k8s API endpoint
            endpoint http://localhost:8080
        }
        # Perform DNS response caching for the coredns.local zone
        # Cache timeout is provided by the integer argument in seconds
        # This works for the kubernetes middleware.)
        #cache 20 coredns.local
        #cache 160 coredns.local
    }


### Internal IP or External IP?
* Should the Corefile configuration allow control over whether the internal IP or external IP is exposed?
* If the Corefile configuration allows control over internal IP or external IP, then the config should allow users to control the precidence.

For example a service "myservice" running in namespace "mynamespace" with internal IP "10.0.0.100" and external IP "1.2.3.4".

This example could be published as:

| Corefile directive           | Result              |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| iporder = internal           | 10.0.0.100          |
| iporder = external           | 1.2.3.4             |
| iporder = external, internal | 10.0.0.100, 1.2.3.4 |
| iporder = internal, external | 1.2.3.4, 10.0.0.100 |
| _no directive_               | 10.0.0.100, 1.2.3.4 |


### Wildcards

Publishing DNS records for singleton services isn't very interesting. Service
names are unique within a k8s namespace therefore multiple services will be
commonly run with a structured naming scheme.

For example, running multiple nginx services under the names:

| Service name |
|--------------|
| c1.nginx     |
| c2.nginx     |

or:

| Service name |
|--------------|
| nginx.c3     |
| nginx.c4     |

A DNS query with wildcard support for "nginx" in these examples should
return the IP addresses for all services with "nginx" in the service name.

TBD:
* How does this relate the the k8s load-balancer configuration?
* Do wildcards search across namespaces? (Yes)
* Initial implementation assumes that a namespace maps to the first DNS label
  below the zone managed by the kubernetes middleware. This assumption may
  need to be revised. (Template scheme for record names removes this assumption.)


## TODO
* SkyDNS compatibility/equivalency:
	* Kubernetes packaging and execution
		* Automate packaging to allow executing in Kubernetes. That is, add Docker
		  container build as target in Makefile. Also include anything else needed
		  to simplify launch as the k8s DNS service.
		  Note: Dockerfile already exists in coredns repo to build the docker image.
		  This work item should identify how to pass configuration and run as a SkyDNS
		  replacement.
		* Identify any kubernetes changes necessary to use coredns as k8s DNS server. That is,
		  how do we consume the "--cluster-dns=" and "--cluster-domain=" arguments.
		* Work out how to pass CoreDNS configuration via kubectl command line and yaml
		  service definition file.
		* Ensure that resolver in each kubernetes container is configured to use
		  coredns instance.
		* Update kubernetes middleware documentation to describe running CoreDNS as a
		  SkyDNS replacement. (Include descriptions of different ways to pass CoreFile
		  to coredns command.)
		* Expose load-balancer IP addresses.
		* Calculate SRV priority based on number of instances running.
		  (See SkyDNS README.md)
	* Functional work
		* (done) ~~Implement wildcard-based lookup. Minimally support `*`, consider `?` as well.~~
        * (done) ~~Note from Miek on PR 181: "SkyDNS also supports the word `any`.~~
		* Implement SkyDNS-style synthetic zones such as "svc" to group k8s objects. (This
		  should be optional behavior.) Also look at "pod" synthetic zones.
		* Implement test cases for SkyDNS equivalent functionality.
	* SkyDNS functionality, as listed in SkyDNS README: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.2/cluster/addons/dns/README.md
		* Expose pods and srv objects.
		* A records in form of `pod-ip-address.my-namespace.cluster.local`.
		  For example, a pod with ip `1.2.3.4` in the namespace `default`
		  with a dns name of `cluster.local` would have an entry:
		  `1-2-3-4.default.pod.cluster.local`.
		* SRV records in form of
		  `_my-port-name._my-port-protocol.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`
		  CNAME records for both regular services and headless services.
		  See SkyDNS README.
		* A Records and hostname Based on Pod Annotations (k8s beta 1.2 feature).
		  See SkyDNS README.
		* Note: the embedded IP and embedded port record names are weird. I
		  would need to know the IP/port in order to create the query to lookup
		  the name. Presumably these are intended for wildcard queries.
	* Performance
		* Improve lookup to reduce size of query result obtained from k8s API.
		  (namespace-based?, other ideas?)
		* Caching of k8s API dataset.
		* DNS response caching is good, but we should also cache at the http query 
		  level as well. (Take a look at https://github.com/patrickmn/go-cache as 
		  a potential expiring cache implementation for the http API queries.)
		* Push notifications from k8s for data changes rather than pull via API?
* Additional features:
	* Implement namespace filtering to different zones. That is, zone "a.b"
	  publishes services from namespace "foo", and zone "x.y" publishes services
	  from namespaces "bar" and "baz". (Basic version implemented -- need test cases.)
	* Reverse IN-ADDR entries for services. (Is there any value in supporting 
	  reverse lookup records?
	* How to support label specification in Corefile to allow use of labels to 
	  indicate zone? (Is this even useful?) For example, the following
	  configuration exposes all services labeled for the "staging" environment
	  and tenant "customerB" in the zone "customerB.stage.local":

			kubernetes customerB.stage.local {
				# Use url for k8s API endpoint
				endpoint http://localhost:8080
				label "environment" : "staging", "tenant" : "customerB"
			}

	  Note: label specification/selection is a killer feature for segmenting
	  test vs staging vs prod environments.
	* Implement IP selection and ordering (internal/external). Related to
	  wildcards and SkyDNS use of CNAMES.
	* Flatten service and namespace names to valid DNS characters. (service names
	  and namespace names in k8s may use uppercase and non-DNS characters. Implement
	  flattening to lower case and mapping of non-DNS characters to DNS characters
	  in a standard way.)
	* Expose arbitrary kubernetes repository data as TXT records?
	* Support custom user-provided templates for k8s names. A string provided
	  in the middleware configuration like `{service}.{namespace}.{type}` defines
	  the template of how to construct record names for the zone. This example
	  would produce `myservice.mynamespace.svc.cluster.local`. (Basic template
	  implemented. Need to slice zone out of current template implementation.)
* DNS Correctness
	* Do we need to generate synthetic zone records for namespaces?
	* Do we need to generate synthetic zone records for the skydns synthetic zones?
* Test cases
	* Test with CoreDNS caching. CoreDNS caching for DNS response is working
	  using the `cache` directive. Tested working using 20s cache timeout
	  and A-record queries. Automate testing with cache in place.
	* Automate CoreDNS performance tests. Initially for zone files, and for
	  pre-loaded k8s API cache.
    * Try to get rid of kubernetes launch scripts by moving operations into
      .travis.yml file.
	* ~~Implement test cases for http data parsing using dependency injection
	  for http get operations.~~
    * ~~Automate integration testing with kubernetes. (k8s launch and service start-up
      automation is in middleware/kubernetes/tests)~~
